# Hello there

In this repo I am planning to have some simple code Katas to freshen up my C# skills. The goal isn't to find the perfect solution, but to have a solution working in under an hour. 

I will also try different approaches of creating C# solutions/projects.

It has been a while since I use Object Oriented Programming so.. yay!
